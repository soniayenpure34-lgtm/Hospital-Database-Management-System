🏥 Hospital Database Management System (SQL Project)
📌 Project Overview

The Hospital Database Management System is a SQL-based relational database project designed to manage hospital operations efficiently. It handles patient records, doctor information, appointments, treatments, and billing details using structured database design principles.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of database normalization, relationships, constraints, and advanced SQL querying techniques.

🎯 Objectives

Design a relational database for hospital management

Implement table relationships using primary and foreign keys

Perform data manipulation and retrieval operations

Execute complex SQL queries for data analysis

🗂️ Database Tables

The system includes the following main entities:

Patients

Doctors

Departments

Appointments

Treatments

Billing

All tables are connected using proper relational constraints.
